# Minecraft Biome Classifier 🌍

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch that identifies Minecraft biomes from in-game screenshots.
Currently, this program only trains and evaluates the network, but in the future will have a fully functioning front and backend where users can upload their images to get a prediction from the pre trained model.
